Dev Notes : 
1. Application is specifically designed for mobile devices as mentioned in the requirement documnet.
2. All components are optimized for maximum performance, memoization on home page can be applied since the parameters are not changing, it could be more optimized.
3. smooth UI is ensured through out the making of this project.
4. very efficiently scalable as both the home and story components are build in a generic manner such that with minimal changes new features and data points can be added.
5. As use of any UI component library was not mentioned, I assumed it could be useful for some icons, rest assured all compoents are built from scratch just the icons are taken from MUI.
6. I deployed the project on render and it went live succesfully, but it was showing error 502, which suggests internal server error hence the data is saved locally in the code.
7. Code for API Calling is present in the project(commented) and it is working flawlessly on local server.
8. Screen shots for the above assumptions is attached at the end in form of a link.
9. Manual testing performed.
